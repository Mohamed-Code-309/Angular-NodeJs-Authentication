# Angular-NodeJs-Authentication
The App focuses on how to use Json Web Token `(JWT)` in both the front end `Angular` and back end `NodeJs` to implement user authentication.

Users cannot enter **special event page** unless they are logged in and have `JWT` stored in the browser.
#
To run this App:
* **ngApp** folder is the front-end _`Angular`_ while **Server** folder is the back-end _`NodeJs`_
* navigate in both folders **ngApp** and **Server** and run the command `npm install` to install the packages
* inside **Server** folder, run the command `node server`
* inside **ngApp** folder, run the command `ng serve --o`
